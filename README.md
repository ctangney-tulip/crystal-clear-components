Enforcing brand guidelines has never been simpler.

## What is this nonsense?

An effort to compile a library of highly composable, supremely reusable, somewhat opinionated visual constructs. The goal is to help make design and interfaces more consistent anywhere that JavaScript plays nicely.

After having worked with a multitude of JavaScript frameworks, CSS libraries, and Front End Templating Engines, I find myself utilizing a fair number of paradigms from these ecosystems in my personal development.

I drew some inspiration from a fair number of these frameworks then went ahead and threw them all together, utilizing native browser API's where ever possible. This means minimal dependencies and ultimately a super lightweight package for your web projects üôÇ

Meant to be an extension to existing, familiar HTML, Crystal Clear Components utilizes the Web Component API to register custom tags, enabling you to write clean, immaculate code while ensuring consistent UI.

## Core Concepts

1. KISS -- Keep It Simple, Stupid.
   When in doubt, utilize the basics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Only use what you need. Don't do anything else. This means...
   - Opt to use existing features. Things like HTML templates, CSS variables, and JavaScript Web Components should all be utilized when possible.
2. Put the user first.
   What the hell does this actually mean? You need to make it make sense to people other than yourself - CJT
3. Write as little code as possible to keep things lightweight.
   - Don't make things obtuse, or difficult to understand: just keep things lean.
4. Add more concepts that make sense as you come up with them.... - CJT

## Still To Do...

1. Code splitting for Components TS / JS
   - This will enable users to embed individual components from the library onto their pages.
2. Pipeline / build stuff
