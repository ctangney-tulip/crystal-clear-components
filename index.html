                An effort to compile a library of highly composable, supremely
                reusable, somewhat opinionated visual constructs. The goal is to 
                help enforce consistent user interfaces and visual experiences 
                across your application.

                After having worked with a multitude of JavaScript frameworks,
                CSS libraries, and Front End Templating Engines, I find myself
                consistently gravitating toward a number of paradigms from
                these ecosystems in my personal development.
              </p>

              <p class="mb-4">
                I drew some inspiration from a fair number of these frameworks
                then went ahead and threw them all together, utilizing native
                browser API's where ever possible. This means minimal
                dependencies and, ultimately, a super lightweight package for your
                web projects :D
              </p>

              <p class="mb-4">
                Meant to be an extension to existing, familiar HTML, "Crystal
                Clear" Components utilizes the Web Component API to register
                custom tags, enabling you to write clean, immaculate code while
                ensuring consistent UI. This means <em>no more Front End templating
                engine<em>. Instead, developers are enabled to spend their time
                focusing on solutions as opposed to learning the Framework Of The Week.
